# HeartFailureClassificationFuzzyKnn
These projects were made to complete the “Introduction to Machine Learning” course at my fourth semester. In the first project, I used Fuzzy KNN. Fuzzy KNN is one of the modified KNN classification algorithms designed to predict test data using the degree value of test data membership in each class. I did classicization using "Heart Failure" data.
